        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my first personal website!
            <br>
            I am a rising freshman at City College and am aspiring to work in cybersecurity, but am open
            <br> to software engineering oppurtunities as well. I've learnt the baselines of several coding languages
            <br> including javascript, html, css, and python. However, I'm on the forefront of learning more languages,
            <br>as well as improving on the ones I know so far. I have been brainsorming ways in which i can use coding
            <br> to help my community, so be on the lookout for future projects!
            <br>
            <br>Apart from coding, I love to swim and bike ride, as well as play games!
